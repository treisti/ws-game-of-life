# WebSocket Game of Life

Collaborative John Conway's Game of Life with WebSocket !


### Introduction

This project is a Node.js server which hosts a Game of Life.
It is using WebSocket (with Express and express-ws).

The map is infinite and shared between all the clients.

This is an experimental project and it would need a lot of improvements.


### How to setup

Clone the repo, then initialise project:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Launch the server:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

Then go to ![http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)


### Dependencies

You need ![Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run this project. The last version will probably work.
